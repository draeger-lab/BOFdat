Welcome to the documentation for BOFdat
=======================================

BOFdat is a package to generate biomass objective function (BOF) for genome-scale models (GEM) from experimental data. The definition of the BOF impacts the quality of phenotypic predictions generated by the model. Often times the BOF is defined using another reconstruction work or another organism. This package is designed to help you stand out of the pack by using experimental data specific to your organism and increase the value of your model. The easiest way to use BOFdat is to download it via pip install (see install). A full usage example, reconstructing the BOF for *Escherichia coli* is available on GitHub, where the entire source code is also available for developers.

General Usage and implementation details
----------------------------------------

BOFdat is conceived as a workflow for the construction of the BOF divided in three independent steps. Following steps 1 to 3 in order should proivde the users with a BOF that matches experimental growth rates and yields a high accuracy of essentiality prediction. Following the workflow is not strictly enforced. We briefly detail each step of the workflow:

**Step1: Generate the stoichiometric coefficients for major macromolecules.** 

We found that the **macromolecular weight fractions (MWF)** are the major determinant of the stoichiometric coefficients. Hence, we advise modellers to query detailed composition of their organism. This signifies determining the absolute dry weight of the cell and the percentage dry weight occupied by the major components: proteins, RNA, lipids, DNA and glycans. For more information on how to obtain this composition experimentally we refer to: `*Beck AE et al*
<https://doi:10.3390/pr6050038>`_

To generate accurate growth rate prediction, obtaining growth and non-growth associated maintenance (GAM and NGAM) ATP costs is usually the most important parameter. Growth rate data on different substrate with quantification of **substrate consumption rate** and **metabolic waste production rate** can be incorporated in Step1 of BOFdat to generate the experimentally determined maintenance costs. We provide an example of such data and, for further experimental reference, we suggest referring to `Monk JM et al
<https://doi:10.1038/nbt.3956>`_

Althought not as critical as MWF, using omics data such as **genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and lipidomic** as a two column .csv file should precise the computation of the stoichiometric coefficients. 

**Step2: Find inorganic ions and coenzymes and generate stoichiometric coefficients.**

Coenzymes and inorganic ions can be hard to identify experimentally. BOFdat Step2 takes care of identifying these ions by comparing the your reconstructed model with the table of universal biomass components generated by `Xavier JC et al
<https://doi:10.1016/j.ymben.2016.12.002>`_

**Step3: Find the remaining species-specific metabolic objective and generate stoichiometric coefficients.** 

The metabolite composition of the BOF reflects the growth requirements of the organism and therefore impacts the gene essentiality prediction of the model. BOFdat provides an unbiased way to determine these metabolic objectives that uses **experimental gene essentiality data**. This is useful for users that which to increase or validate the essentiality prediction formualted by the model. This requires a genome-wide essentiality dataset. Usually this type of data is obtained with high-throughput insertion of transposon or, more rarely, with genome-wide single gene knock-out. For more details on experimental high-throughput transposon insertion see `van Opijnen T et al
<https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.1377>`_


A good example of genome-wide single gene knock-out is the "Keio collection" for *E. coli*, see Baba T et al
