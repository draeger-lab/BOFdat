Welcome to the documentation for BOFdat
=======================================

BOFdat is a package to generate biomass objective function (BOF) for genome-scale models (GEM) from experimental data. The definition of the BOF impacts the quality of phenotypic predictions generated by the model. Often times the BOF is defined using another reconstruction work or another organism. This package is designed to help you stand out of the pack by using experimental data specific to your organism and increase the value of your model. The easiest way to use BOFdat is to download it via pip install (see install). A full usage example, reconstructing the BOF for *Escherichia coli* is available on GitHub, where the entire source code is also available for developers.

General Usage and implementation details
----------------------------------------

BOFdat is conceived as a workflow for the construction of the BOF divided in three independent steps. Following steps 1 to 3 in order should proivde the users with a BOF that matches experimental growth rates and yields a high accuracy of essentiality prediction. Following the workflow is not strictly enforced. We briefly detail each step of the workflow:

*Step1:* Generate the stoichiometric coefficients for major macromolecules. 

*Step2:* Find inorganic ions and coenzymes and generate stoichiometric coefficients.

*Step3:* Find the remaining species-specific metabolic objective and generate stoichiometric coefficients. 

Installation
------------

BOFdat can be installed using pip::
   
   pip install BOFdat
